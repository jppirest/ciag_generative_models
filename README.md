# ciag_generative_models

---

#### Repository to mantain notebooks of the Generative Models Module of the *CIAG (Artificial Intelligence Applied to Geoscience)* 2024, taught to [Petrobras](https://petrobras.com.br/) employees.

The topics, as well as their implementation, are divided as follows:

1. [x] autoencoders
2. [x] variational autoencoders (vae)
3. [ ] GANs basic
4. [ ] conditional GANs (cGANs) 
5. [x] image2image translation using GANs (pix2pix) 
6. [x] normalizing flows 
7. [ ] diffusion models

The autoencoder and VAE modules are entirely created from scratch, whereas the pix2pix and NFs are built upon existing notebooks, supplemented with additional documentation and discussions. 

Furthermore, GANs basic and cGAN are based on past CIAG notebooks, while the difussion models notebook were made by Breno Mariano. These notebooks are yet to be included into this repository.

The theoretical background expected to be understood was covered in the separeted classes, and in the notebooks, we only discuss minor details of these generative models and **do not cover** the mathematical background needed to build these networks. Finally, the notebooks utilize toy datasets for educational purposes.
